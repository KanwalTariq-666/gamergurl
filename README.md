## Insert, update, delete, select = resources

### Resource page:
To access the resource page requires login initially, but you can continue as a guest!

I didn't have time to integrate, so I implemented a separate guest view. You can only view resources, comment, and give kudos in guest view.

As a member, you can insert, edit, delete, update your resources.

As admin, you have universal control over all resources.

I tried using all that we studied this semester in this assignment:

- HTML semantics
- CSS (animations also in the header)
- JS for DOM (add event listeners, functions, query selectors, etc)
- PHP
- AJAX (I tried)
- MySQL database

For some reason, the navigation started giving me problems after I did something with AJAX for resources. For now, I've implemented an inline style in HTML directly for viewing purposes.

I also ended up giving a few divs here and there for responsive purposes.

I tried to organize my code as much as I could for better reading. I'm not perfect on my indenting yet.

Thanks for reading!
